# Hackathon project

```
* This is an onchain Raffle Draw that uses oracle for its randomness  *

## A user connects his wallet to it and buys a ticket

## When the ticket is sold out, the owner address then calls the oracle to fulfil Randomness and return a random number which will be used to select the winner of the raffle
## An NFT is then minted to this winner and the cycle continues.
